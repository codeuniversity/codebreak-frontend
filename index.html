        <h1>What are we doing?</h1>
        <p>C<>DEbreak is a platform for CODE students to organise their lunch breaks – 
            we like efficiency after all. Find all of our available options below!</p>

    
            <div id="preorder">
                <h2>Pre Order</h2>
                    <img src="assets/logos/calendar.png" alt="calendar">
                    <p>With the pre-order option you can order your lunch a day before so you can 
                        have a simplified lunchtime. From the preselected restaurant of the day you 
                        can pick dark meat, light meat, or veggie.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>Head Out</h2>
                <img src="assets/logos/cutlery.png" alt="cutlery">
                <p>Organize a group of CODE students to go out and eat together – 
                    with none of the issues of asking around to find out who wants 
                    to join and when to go. You’ll take care of all that ahead of time.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="takeaway">
                <h2>Take away</h2>
                <img src="assets/logos/shopping_bag.png" alt="shopping">
                <p>Order food together and bring it back to campus! You can create 
                    a notification to let other CODE students know that you’ll be 
                    heading out to a restaurant to grab some food. You’ll bring it all 
                    back, they’ll pay you, and that’s it!</p>
