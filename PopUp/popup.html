        <p>Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today lounge in doorway, cats go for world domination. Lick butt drool always hungry but instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Sleep on keyboard. My left donut is missing, as is my right cat slap dog in face, and head nudges for going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red dot today i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box but your pillow is now my pet bed. Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) mark territory, and bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face. Immediately regret falling into bathtub lick the curtain just to be annoying. </p>
